# Basketball dataset

This repository contains data of basketball games played in different basketball leagues. The purpose of this dataset is to collect and organize
data of **high granularity** from as many basketball games as possible.

This is an ongoing project. I will try to regularly fix the possible mistakes in the data,
update the datasets and increase the granularity of the data, if that is possible.

Directory [src/](src/) contains the code that was used to download, scrape, collect and edit all the data that is in [data/](data/).

Data is published in **parquet** format.

Currently data available for the following leagues:
* [Euroleague](data/euroleague)
* [Eurocup](data/eurocup)
* [ABA League](data/aba)
